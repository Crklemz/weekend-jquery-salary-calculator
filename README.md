jquery salary calculator

## Description

This calculator takes in 5 inputs (First name, Last name, ID, Title, Annual Salary), creates objects (employees) and stores them employee array.

The main function is to calculate the total monthly cost of employing the added amployees, which I did by adding up the annual salaries and dividing the total by 12 months.
